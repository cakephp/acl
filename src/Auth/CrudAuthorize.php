 * An authorization adapter for AuthComponent. Provides the ability to authorize using CRUD mappings.
 * CRUD mappings allow you to translate controller actions into *C*reate *R*ead *U*pdate *D*elete actions.
 * This is then checked in the AclComponent as specific permissions.
 *
 * For example, taking `/posts/index` as the current request. The default mapping for `index`, is a `read` permission
 * check. The Acl check would then be for the `posts` controller with the `read` permission. This allows you
 * to create permission systems that focus more on what is being done to resources, rather than the specific actions
 * being visited.
